# Linear Algebra 2 Tools
Thanks to Corona, the type for the LinA2 exam was changed to OpenBook, meaning we were allowed to throw everything we had at it, like WolframAlpha or Matlab. 

I decided to go with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and Math.js, as this gave me the fastest development time because im most familiar with it. I also had to use some Python because the Eigenvektor Solver of Math.js only computes them numerically. Therefore I went with Flask and sympy.

I didn't originally planned to release the code, this repo was originally set to private, because I was in a hurry, but whatever.
